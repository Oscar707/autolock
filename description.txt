create a python app that automatically accepts matches for league of legends players
functions to use:
im1 = pyautogui.screenshot()
locate(needleImage, haystackImage, grayscale=True)
pyautogui.hotkey('alt', 'tab') 
pyautogui.write('Hello world!', interval=0.25)
pyautogui.click(get_center('random.png')

phase detection:
while true loop:
takes a screenshot every 2 seconds, looks for 3 things that will determine which phase we are in.


phase 1: accept (by seeing accept match button, we know this phase is over if we see search2.png, otherwise we keep looping)
edge case: sometimes not everyone accept, so we have to accept more than twice, so if we see search2.png we can confidently say that phase1 is over (put a message in display box: 

pseudo code:
while (pyautogui.locateOnScreen('looksLikeThis.png') == None:
	look for accept button:


phase 2: ban champions (we know this phase starts we see ban_a_champ.png, we know its over when we see bans_locked_in.png)
message1: Starting ban phase
message2: Ban phase over!

phase 3: pick champ (we know this phase starts when we see pick_your_champion.png, we know its over when we see prepare_for_battle.png)
message1: Starting pick phase
message2: Pick phase over!

Default text box: Select you phases and press start!
